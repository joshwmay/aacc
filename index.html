        <h2>Assessing Anne Arundel Community College</h2>
        <p>Located in the heart of the DMV, AACC <i>stands out</i> for several good reasons. The interactive visuals above attempt to illustrate the value of an education at AACC
            by familiarizing users with things like tuition pricing, professor salaries, and a mapped out glimpse into school locations and notes about their student bodies.
            Together these details can help prospective students or educators decide if AACC is right for them, or even more specific organizational/analysis like pay raises.<br><br> 
            Adding emphasis to the 'Community' in 'Community College', the school recently expanded <a href="https://wapo.st/3Jn1YVV">thanks to a sizable donation and a notable 
            fundraising campaign</a>. With a sizable percentage of both GI Bill recipients and students over the age of 25, Anne Arundel Community College is a great option for continued 
            education for someone that may be a little further removed from high school or recently got out of the military. The proximity of the campus to the State Capital, Fort Meade, a 
            bevy of federal headquarters, Baltimore, and the District of Columbia; the school is in a <a href="https://bit.ly/3FC3XDP">caldera</a> of job and internship opportunities.<br>
